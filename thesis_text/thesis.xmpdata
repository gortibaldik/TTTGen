\Title{Generating text from structured data}
\Keywords{text generation\sep structured data\sep natural language processing\sep neural networks}
\Subject{In this thesis we examine ways of generating document-scale natural language text conditioned on structured input data. Specifically we train Deep Neural Network models on recently introduced RotoWire dataset containing statistical data about basketball matches paired with descriptive summaries. At first we analyse the dataset and propose several preprocessing methods (i.e. Byte Pair Encoding). Next we train a baseline model based on the Encoder-Decoder architecture on the preprocessed dataset. We discuss several problems of the baseline and explore advanced Deep Neural Network architectures that aim to solve them (Copy attention, Content Selection, Content Planning). We hypothesize that our models are not able to learn the structure of the input data and we propose a method reducing its complexity. Our best model trained on the simplified data manages to outperform the baseline by more than 5 BLEU points.}
