\chapter{Problem statement}
Recent years have seen a big surge of utilisation of deep neural networks in the field of Natural Language Processing. While most work focuses on neural machine translation, the aim of this thesis is to explore the task of natural language generation conditioned on the input database.

\section{Data to text generation}
Known datasets (WIKIBIO, WeatherGov, RoboCup) -> short description, the generated summaries are one-two sentences long. Rotowire -> really long summaries although only a fraction of the number of unique tokens from the WIKIBIO dataset. Only short description of the dataset, the statistics and observations are in the second chapter.

\section{Fantasy sports}
What it is, where it originates, the relation to basic optimisation problems, why NLGenerated summaries could be added value.

\section{My goal}
Fluent text which captures the important statistics from the table
