\chapter{Experiments} \label{experiments_chapter}
This chapter should present the observations about the generated data and the steps taken to improve the generations.

\section{BLEU}
What it is, why do I use such a metric for evaluating the data.

\section{Manual evaluation}
How the summaries for manual evaluation are chosen, how many people do evaluate the predicted summaries.

\section{Other evaluation approaches}
Which approaches are presented in the read papers, which improvements should be made.

\section{Results of the baseline model}
Learned which teams play, what are the greatest stars of each team, although the summaries diverge, only first few sentences from the generated summaries are relevant.

\section{Dropout}
What it is, where I apply the dropout - on the decoder LSTM cells.

\section{Scheduled Sampling}
What it is, how it solves the divergence of the summaries.

\section{Copy methods}
How do they help the model to choose more relevant data from the table, how do they fare in the concurrence of the baseline model.
