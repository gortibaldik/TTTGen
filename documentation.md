### What is `tf.function`
- official guide from tensorflow : https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#setup
- analysis of `tf.function` : [part1](https://pgaleone.eu/tensorflow/tf.function/2019/03/21/dissecting-tf-function-part-1/), [part2](https://pgaleone.eu/tensorflow/tf.function/2019/04/03/dissecting-tf-function-part-2/)
- discussion about the issue I faced (training multiple independent models using the same `tf.function`) [stack_overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60704587/training-multiple-models-defined-from-the-same-class-in-tensorflow-2-0-fails-whe)
